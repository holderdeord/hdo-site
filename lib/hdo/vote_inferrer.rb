module Hdo
  #
  # This class deals with the problem of non-personal votes.
  #
  # This happens when the parliament doesn't use the voting system
  # to decide on an issue, but instead e.g. asks representatives to
  # rise if they disagree.
  #
  # If we have another vote from the same day, it's reasonable to assume
  # that the same set of representatives were present while the
  # non-personal vote was decided.
  #
  # Unfortunately, for some meetings, all votes will be non-personal.
  # These are ignored.
